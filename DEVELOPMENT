Capybara::Persona sits in the middle of a bunch of things, and unfortunately
this position makes it a bit difficult and fragile to test.  Nevertheless,
it's still possible to exercise the codebase.

Here's the short version.  From the root of the source tree:

    $ git submodule update --init   # get the Mozilla BrowserID code
    $ cd features/support/browserid
    $ npm install                   # sets up said code
    $ npm start

In a separate shell, go to the root of the source tree and run

    $ bundle exec rake

This will run capybara-persona's integration tests using the default Selenium
WebDriver configuration, which usually uses Firefox.  You can use Chromedriver
if you want:

    $ DRIVER=chrome bundle exec rake

# vim:ts=2:sw=2:et:tw=78
