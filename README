Developers building Web applications that use Mozilla Persona for
authentication have a few choices when it comes to subjecting authenticated
actions to automated integration testing:

a. Don't
b. Use a non-Persona authentication flow
c. Use Persona for authentication

(a) is usually not acceptable.  (b) can work for webapps that support multiple
authentication flows (i.e. they're using Persona as an alternate
authentication mechanism), but leaves webapps that use Persona exclusively out
in the cold.

(c) is nice, but the author found no such tools for Capybara/Cucumber
integration testing.  Hence this library.

This library provides an object that can be used to sign in using Mozilla
Persona.  It assumes that registration will be handled over a separate
channel.  See doc/automatic_registration.txt for possible solutions to the
problem of automatic registration.

2. Usage

Let's say you have a Cucumber scenario like this:

    Feature: Create a new widget
      Scenario: Authenticated users can make widgets
        Given I sign in as "test@example.org":"foobar123"

        When I go to the new widget page
        And I fill in the data
          | name          | A gadget         |
          | manufacturer  | Interwidgets LLC |
        And I press "Save"

        Then I see the widget
          | name          | A gadget         |
          | manufacturer  | Interwidgets LLC |

capybara-persona helps implement the sign-in bit.

Declare a Capybara::Persona object in the Cucumber world:

    class TestWorld
      def persona
        @persona ||= Capybara::Persona.new
      end
    end

    World { TestWorld.new }

Then, in your sign-in step:

    Given /^I sign in as "([^"])+":"([^"])+"$/ do |email, password|
      # how you summon the Persona sign-in screen is app-dependent
      step %q{When I click "Sign in"}

      persona.set_email(email)
      persona.set_password(password)
      persona.submit_credentials

      step %q{Then I see some indication that I've signed in}
    end

Capybara::Persona is built on top of Capybara's synchronization code, and will
wait for e.g. the Persona window to appear and disappear.

Because Capybara::Persona clicks through a Persona login flow like a human
would, it will use the same Persona polyfill and verification backend that
your webapp uses.
